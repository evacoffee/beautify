- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Session tokens are securely generated and validated

### Input Validation
- All user input is strictly validated
- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements
- XSS protection through output encoding

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- No runtime dependencies with known vulnerabilities

## Secure Development Guidelines

### Code Review
